The whole material covers the aspect of handling of Big data with SQL, some Python libraries and R.

The python codes are in jupyter notebook and run from there, so if you are a linux user, then you will have to set up your jupyter notebook

and if you are a windows user you will need to set it up also or use the anaconda software incase probs come up.

Also the R codes are in ipython and will run well after installing the necessary Rpy packages and libraries

The link provided is about the whole gist and runs about the event.
